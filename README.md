## Introduction

This report provides a summary of covid19_data, which includes global statistics. The data is compiled 
from reputable sources, i.e the World Health Organization (WHO).

## Project overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze and report on COVID-19 data to provide insights into the global 
spread and rapid impact of the COVID-19 virus. The aim of this project is to understand the trends in
